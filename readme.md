# TFC Currency
This is an addon for [TerraFirmaCraft TNG](https://github.com/TerraFirmaCraft/TerraFirmaCraft) adding currency related items to the game. Currently there are 4 coin tiers: Copper, Silver, Gold and Platinum Coins that are craftable in the TFC Anvil from metal sheets. Currently each sheet adds 10 coins.


### Planned features:

- Maybe more coin materials (bronze, maybe others?)

- Clay molds for early coin making with a slightly smaller yield (maybe 2-3 coins / 100 units instead of 5)

- Coin exchanging (example: 100 copper to 1 silver unshaped recipe)

- More translations if required (feel free to create a pull request if you would like to!)


### Credits:

- Original coin icons are from [Ordinary Coins](https://github.com/OrdinaryMinecraft/OrdinaryCoins) mod from [flametaichou](https://github.com/flametaichou) (licensed under MIT)

- Big thank you for the TFC and TFC-TNG devs for this amazing mod!


### Contributors:
